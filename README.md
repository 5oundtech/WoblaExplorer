# WoblaExplorer
Simple explorer-like application with some new features.

## Features list:
- [x] Recursive search (not like windows explorer search, this one is using contains)
- [x] Simple error handler not message box
- [x] Basic features of windows explorer (open, copy, paste, remove, rename etc)
- [x] Make app localizable at runtime (now its half russian half english)
- [x] Make properties window
- [ ] Make tooltip on current app or file with short info
- [x] Autoupdater -> [Codeplex ClickOnce installer](https://woblaexplorer.codeplex.com/)

I'm developing this app alone so i'll appreciate any help. (Criticism, pull requests etc)
